**Implementation:**
- `connectMetaMask()` - Connects to MetaMask wallet with signature verification
- `connectTronLink()` - Connects to TronLink wallet with signature verification
- Automatic wallet detection and connection flow
- Chain ID detection and network validation

### 2. **Create New Wallet (Client-Side)**

**Features:**
- BIP39 mnemonic generation (12 or 24 words)
- Client-side only wallet creation (never sends seeds to backend)
- Ethereum-compatible wallet derivation using ethers.js
- Comprehensive seed phrase verification process

**Security Features:**
- One-time seed phrase display with security warnings
- Mandatory verification step (word selection in correct order)
- 3-attempt limit for verification
- Screenshot prevention warnings
- Strong disclaimers about wallet recovery

### 3. **Wallet Management Dashboard**

**Capabilities:**
- View connected wallet address and provider
- Network switching and validation
- Private key management (for ALLEGRA-created wallets)
- Wallet settings and preferences
- Transaction history and balance tracking
- Export functionality (keystore files, wallet data)

**Enterprise Features:**
- Multiple wallet support
- CSV export of transaction history
- Advanced security settings
- Custom gas limit configuration

### 4. **Transaction Management**

**Supported Operations:**
- **Deposits**: USDT amount selection → smart contract interaction
- **Withdrawals**: Post-lock period fund release
- **Reward Claims**: Automated reward distribution
- **Timer Integration**: Blockchain timestamp synchronization

**Security Features:**
- Pre-transaction confirmation modals
- Comprehensive security warnings
- Compliance disclaimers
- Transaction fee estimation
- Irreversible transaction warnings

### 5. **Security & Compliance**

**Implemented Warnings:**
- "Only connect wallets you control. Never share your private keys."
- "Blockchain transactions are irreversible. Ensure correct address and chain."
- "Never share your seed phrase. Anyone with it can control your funds."
- KYC/AML compliance placeholders for enterprise accounts

**Technical Security:**
- Client-side wallet generation
- Encrypted keystore export
- Private key isolation
- No server-side seed storage

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### Dependencies Added
```json
{
  "ethers": "^6.x.x",
  "bip39": "^3.x.x", 
  "tronweb": "^5.x.x",
  "crypto-js": "^4.x.x"
}
```

### Key Functions

#### Wallet Generation
```typescript
const generateWallet = async (wordCount: 12 | 24): Promise<WalletCreationResult>
```

#### Wallet Connection
```typescript
const connectMetaMask = async (): Promise<WalletConnectionResult>
const connectTronLink = async (): Promise<WalletConnectionResult>
```

#### Transaction Management
```typescript
const deposit = (amount: string, token: string): Promise<TransactionResult>
const withdraw = (amount: string, token: string): Promise<TransactionResult>
const claimRewards = (amount: string, token: string): Promise<TransactionResult>
```

### State Management

The wallet state is managed through the `AuthContext` with the following structure:

```typescript
interface AuthContextType {
  walletInfo: WalletInfo | null;
  connectWalletInfo: (wallet: WalletInfo) => void;
  disconnectWallet: () => void;
  isWalletConnected: boolean;
}
```

## 🎯 User Experience Flow

### 1. **First-Time User**
1. Sign up/Sign in to ALLEGRA
2. Choose "Create New Wallet" or "Connect Existing Wallet"
3. If creating: Generate seed phrase → Backup → Verify → Success
4. If connecting: Select provider → Sign message → Connected
5. Access DApp with wallet functionality

### 2. **Returning User**
1. Sign in to ALLEGRA
2. Wallet automatically reconnected (if session valid)
3. Access DApp with full wallet features
4. Manage wallet through Settings tab

### 3. **Transaction Flow**
1. User initiates transaction (deposit/withdrawal/reward)
2. Security warning modal appears
3. User confirms transaction details
4. Wallet signs transaction
5. Transaction broadcast to blockchain
6. Confirmation and status tracking

## 🔒 Security Considerations

### Implemented Safeguards
- **Client-side generation**: Seeds never touch server
- **One-time display**: Seed phrases shown only once
- **Verification required**: Mandatory word verification
- **Strong warnings**: Multiple security disclaimers
- **Private key protection**: Never stored in plain text
- **Transaction confirmations**: All actions require explicit consent

### Best Practices
- Use HTTPS in production
- Implement rate limiting
- Add transaction monitoring
- Regular security audits
- User education materials
